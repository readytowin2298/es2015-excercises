# ES2015 Module Exercise
## This exercise gives you practice with ES2015-style import/export.

So that we can work with import/export, we’ll use create-react-app to get a starter skeleton. However, we won’t be building an actual React app.

So: start by deleting everything inside of the src/ directory, and then doing your work inside of this now-empty directory.

## Requirements
For this assignment you should create three JavaScript files:

### src/helpers.js
This file should export two array helper functions:

choice(items): returns a randomly selected item from array of items
remove(items, item): removes the first matching item from items, if item exists, and returns it. Otherwise returns undefined.
### src/foods.js
This file should export this array of fruits:

[
  "🍇", "🍈", "🍉", "🍊", "🍋", "🍌", "🍍", "🍎",
  "🍏", "🍐", "🍒", "🍓", "🥝", "🍅", "🥑",
];
### src/index.js
This file should import the fruits and both array helpers. It should then:

 - Randomly draw a fruit from the array
 - Log the message “I’d like one RANDOMFRUIT, please.”
 - Log the message “Here you go: RANDOMFRUIT”
 - Log the message “Delicious! May I have another?”
 - Remove the fruit from the array of fruits
 - Log the message “I’m sorry, we’re all out. We have FRUITSLEFT left.”


### Testing This
Run this with npm start and you should see something like this in your browser console:

> I'd like one 🍉, please
>
> Here you go: 🍉
>
> Delicious! May I have another?
>
> I'm sorry, we're all out. We have 14 left.
